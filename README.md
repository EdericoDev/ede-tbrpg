```

### **2. Navigate to the Project Folder**

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **4. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**
- **Game doesn't start:**
    - Ensure Python is installed correctly and that you‚Äôre using Python 3.8 or higher.
    - Ensure you're in the correct directory (`cd rpg-game`).
  
- **Missing `pip`:**
    - Reinstall Python with `pip` included or install `pip` manually by following [this guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

- **Game crashes during enemy attack:**
    - Ensure your Python environment is clean. Try deleting the `venv` folder and recreating it with:
